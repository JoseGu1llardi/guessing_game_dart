## 📖 About the Project

This repository contains a **Number Guessing Game** built with **Dart**. Created as part of a practical coursework exercise, this project focuses on consolidating programming fundamentals, logic flow, and syntax mastery within the Dart ecosystem.

The primary goal was to build a functional Command Line Interface (CLI) application that interacts with the user, handles input validation, and manages game state effectively.

## 🚀 Features

- **Random Number Generation:** Generates a secret number within a predefined range.
- **Interactive CLI:** User-friendly interface running directly in the terminal.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provides hints if the guess is higher or lower than the target.
- **Attempt Tracking:** Counts and displays the number of attempts made by the user.
- **Input Validation:** Handles invalid inputs gracefully to prevent crashes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Dart
- **Environment:** Command Line Interface (CLI)
- **Core Libraries:**
  - `dart:math` (For random number generation)
  - `dart:io` (For standard input/output operations)
